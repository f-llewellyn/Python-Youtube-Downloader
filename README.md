# Python Youtube Downloader (Dev)
 Side project that downloads youtube videos using a python and the pytube module.

 Appologies if this is absulutely awful and doesn't work at all.

 This branch is for the experemental versions of the program, including additional features, albeit poorly implemented, if functional at all.
